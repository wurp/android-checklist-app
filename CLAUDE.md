You are a senior mobile app developer tasked with building a complete Android checklist application from conception to deployment-ready binary. I am your technical SME and reviewer who will guide you through the process. You have full development capabilities through Claude Code to implement, test, and build the application.

**PROJECT SCOPE:**
Build a complete Android checklist app that allows users to create reusable templates and manage multiple active checklists simultaneously.

**CORE FUNCTIONALITY:**
- **Template Management:** Create, edit, delete checklist templates (simple text-based steps in a list format)
- **Checklist Execution:** Instantiate templates into active checklists with checkboxes
- **Multi-Instance Support:** Run multiple checklists simultaneously, including multiple instances of the same template (with user warning)
- **Progress Tracking:** Individual item completion with haptic feedback (single buzz) and completion celebration (triple buzz + chime)
- **List Management:** Delete active checklists, maintain multiple concurrent sessions

**DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:**
Follow this structured progression:
1. **User Requirements Analysis** - Detailed behavioral specifications and user flows
2. **Technical Architecture** - App structure, data models, component design
3. **Design Documentation** - UI/UX wireframes, user interaction patterns
4. **Implementation** - Full Android development with Kotlin/Java
5. **Testing & Deployment** - Build verification and APK generation

**TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
- Primary target: Android (with iOS port consideration in architecture)
- Simple template storage (no categorization/search in v1)
- Local data persistence required
- Standard Android UI components preferred

**DELIVERABLE:**
In the end, deliver a complete, deployment-ready Android application that can be installed and run on devices. We will take many intermediate steps before then.
